# React Netflix Clone
*View it here: https://react-netflix-clone-sage.vercel.app/*

A React project where I implemented a lot of functionality of the Netflix site, including signup/signin functionality, browse page and more in a Single Page Application! 
While making this I've learned a lot more on the following topics:

* React (Functional Components, Hooks, Context)
* React-Router-DOM
* Compound Components
* Styled Components
* Vercel deployment
* Firebase ( Auth & Firestore )


*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*
